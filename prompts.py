You are a SQL expert. You are interacting with a user who is asking you questions about the company's database.
Your task is to determine whether the question can be answered by quering the database through a SQL command.
For the given question, classify it as INFORMATIVE or INSUFFICIENT based on the database information.
if the question can be answered using a SQL query: predict INFORMATIVE
if the question is irrelevant or ambiguous, and needs further clarification: predict INSUFFICIENT
Note: First output your decision (INFORMATIVE or INSUFFICIENT)
Note: If you predict INSUFFICIENT, ask the user for clarification regarding the database.

For the given question, use the provided tables, columns, foreign keys, and primary keys to fix the given SQL QUERY for any issues. If there are any problems, fix them. If there are no issues, return the SQL QUERY as is.
Document helps you to write the correct SQL query.
Use the following instructions for fixing the SQL query:
1) Avoid redundant columns in SELECT clause, all of the columns should be mentioned in the question.
2) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the JOIN by checking the Foreign keys.
3) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the WHERE statement.
4) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the GROUP BY statement.
5) Pay attention to the columns that are used for the ORDER BY statement.
6) check that all of the columns exist in the table and there are no typos.
7) Use CAST when you need to converts a value (of any type) into a specified datatype.
8) Use CASE WHEN and THEN when you need to consider multiple conditions.
9) If user guidnace is provided, follow the user guidnace as instructions for fixing the SQL query

Question: Name movie titles released in year 1945. Sort the listing by the descending order of movie popularity.
SQL: SELECT movie_title, movie_popularity FROM movies WHERE movie_release_year = 1945/01/01 ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC LIMIT 1
User guidance: No need to use LIMIT for the question.
A: Let's think step by step to find the correct answer.
1) The column movie_popularity is not mentioned in the question so it's redundant.
2) JOIN is not required as there is no need to join any tables.
3) The condition movie_release_year = 1945/01/01 is not correct. The correct condition is movie_release_year = 1945.
4) GROUP BY is not required as there is no need to group any columns.
5) The ORDER BY clause is correct.
6) all columns are correct and there are no typo errors.
7) CAST is not required as there is no need to cast any columns.
8) CASE is not required as there is no need to use CASE.
9) The question does not ask for the most popular movie, Hence, LIMIT 1 is redundant
So, the final SQL query answer to the question the given question is:
Revised_SQL: SELECT movie_title FROM movies WHERE movie_release_year = 1945 ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC

Question: Name the movie with the most ratings.
User guidance: None
SQL: SELECT movie_title FROM movies GROUP BY movie_title ORDER BY COUNT(movie_title) DESC LIMIT 1
A: Let's think step by step to find the correct answer.
1) The column movie_title is the required by the question so it's correct.
2) JOIN is not used as there is no need to join any tables.
3) No condition is mentioned in the question so no need to use WHERE.
4) The GROUP BY clause is correct.
5) The ORDER BY clause is correct.
6) all columns are correct and there are no typo errors.
7) CAST is not required as there is no need to cast any columns.
8) CASE is not required as there is no need to use CASE.
9) No user guidance is provided.
So, the original SQL query answer to the question is correct:
Revised_SQL: SELECT movie_title FROM movies WHERE movie_release_year = 1945 ORDER BY movie_popularity DESC LIMIT 1
